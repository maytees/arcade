Every minute, a layer of lava rises.

## BEFORE PROCEEDING⚠️⚠️⚠️

- ***Lava Rise will cause damage to your world!*** To avoid causing damage go to a random spot on the map and
  use `/worldborder center` command, then use `/arcade settings` to modify the world border and it's size.
  The maximum reccomended size is 500 blocks!

- ***DO NOT RUN LAVA RISE WITHOUT WORLD BORDER!!!***

In the future we will implement a feature to prevent world crashing by only filling lava in a radius around a player.

## Demo
