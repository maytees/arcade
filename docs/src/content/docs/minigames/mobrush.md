Every block you break spawns a random mob!

## Demo
![Demo](/mobrushdemo.gif)
*Disclaimer, currently there is a bug where two or more mob types spawn.*
*As you can see, Parrots, Drowned and Ravegers spawn at the same time.*

## Settings

Mob Rush has a few settings to offer.

### Random Mob Count
*Boolean Setting*

If this is enabled, then Arcade will pick a random amount of mobs to spawn between 1 and `Max Mob Count`.
If it's disabled, Arcade will just spawn `Max Mob Count` amount of mobs.

### Max Mob Count
*Integer Setting*

The maximum amount of mobs to spawn.

### Enable Hostile mobs
*Boolean Setting*

Set whether you want hostile mobs to spawn.

### Enable Peaceful Mobs
*Boolean Setting*

Set whether you want peaceful mobs to spawn.

### Disclaimer!

- If both `Enable Hostile Mobs` and `Enable Peaceful Mobs` are set to false, no mobs will spawn on block break.
