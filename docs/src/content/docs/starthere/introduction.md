Welcome to the Arcade documentation!

## What is Arcade?
Arcade is a Minecraft server side plugin which brings customizable minigames/tweaks
to survival minecraft. The inspiration for this project are youtubers such as Dream,
GeorgeNotFound, and many others, who create videos on these types of challenges.

## Disclaimer
*Arcade is currently in Alpha, so expect bugs while using the plugin*

We do not recommend using this plugin in a production level minecraft server, as
it's mainly meant to bring tweaks for you to play with your friends.

But you are very welcome to incorporate this into your Minecraft server however
you wish.

## Future

<!-- See [Roadmap](/roadmap) for the future possibilities of Arcade -->

We plan to add as many tweaks as possible to Arcade, so you can have as much fun as possible with
your friends.

### Hosting
As Arcade expands, we want to turn this project into some sort of minigame server hosting
solution. If you want to quickly spin up a server with your friends to play, the plan is to be
able to via a website. But this wouldn't be a typical server hosting solution, but rather
a dedicated one for the Arcade plugin, where you're able to tweak the plugin/minigames via a web
console.
